# Data

The folder `all_phenotypes` contains phenotype files for all 8 phages -- the phenotype in this case is the susceptibility of all the isolates to a phage, displayed in binary format (0: not infected, 1: infected)

`gene_presence_absence.Rtab` contains a presence/absence matrix of genes and clusters of orthologous genes (COGs) in all the isolates.

`list_of_strains_used.txt` contains the list of isolates used in this analysis (there are 476 in total).

`suggestive_COGs_4phages_unique.txt` contains a list of all GWAS-identified genes and COGs above the suggestive threshold.

`suggestive_COGs_{phage}_unique.txt` contains a list of GWAS-identified genes and COGs above the suggestive threshold for a particular {phage}.
