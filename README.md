# Predictive models of phage susceptibility in *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*

This repository contains machine learning models to predict phage susceptibility in 476 *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* isolates. Significant genes and clusters of orthologous genes (COGs), identified through a genome-wide association study (GWAS), were used as input features. The susceptibility of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* isolates to 8 different phages were served as the target variables.

This work is part of the master's thesis titled "**Discovering genetic determinants of phage host range in *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*: Genome-wide association study and predictive modeling of phage susceptibility**", conducted within the Computational Systems Biology research group at KU Leuven, Belgium.
