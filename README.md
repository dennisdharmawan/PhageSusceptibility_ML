# Machine learning models to predict phage susceptibility

This repository contains machine learning models to predict phage susceptibility in *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* isolates. Significant genes and clusters of orthologous genes (COGs) discovered through genome-wide association study (GWAS) were used as input features, and susceptibility of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* isolates to 8 different phages were used as target variables.

The contents of this repository are a part of the master's thesis titled "Discovering genetic determinants of phage host range in *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*: Genome-wide association study and predictive modeling of phage susceptibility". The thesis was conducted in the Computational Systems Biology research group at KU Leuven, Belgium.
